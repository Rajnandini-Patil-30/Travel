**Travel-Manager-API**

Travel management system built with ASP.NET Core and .NET. This project provides a robust Web API for managing travel-related data, including tourists, destinations, and bookings. The backend is designed to be consumed by a separate frontend application, offering a clean separation of concerns.

The core of the application is a PostgreSQL database, with data modeling and interactions managed by Entity Framework Core. This ensures data integrity and a scalable data access layer.

For the frontend, the API is designed to be used with a React.js application, allowing for a modern and dynamic user interface. The entire system is built for reliability, with comprehensive unit and integration tests written using xUnit.net to guarantee a high-quality, bug-free experience.

**Features**
Tourist Management: Endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting tourist information.

Destination Management: Manage travel destinations with details like country, price, and description.

Booking System: A core functionality to link tourists with destinations, handling booking details and costs.

RESTful API: All endpoints are designed to be RESTful, providing predictable and easy-to-use access to resources.
